First line of input contains the number of queries
each query of type
0 <key> <data>  # inserts into tree
1 <center> <range>  # prints the data >= center - range and >= center + range
4 # to print the entire tree

Right now I am using bplustree.config to store some more
information about the tree (root, size). Place the max no. of keys in the file bplustree.config.bkp and place a 0 after that


make clean # remove all the data
make # recompile
